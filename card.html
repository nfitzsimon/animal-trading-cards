				Sea otter fur is the densest of any mammal on earth, forming a
				wetsuit-like layer of protection against cold waters instead of a
				blubber layer.

			<p>
				Sea otters are playful and intelligent. Being one of the few mammals
				to use tools, they have pouches of loose skin that allow them to store
				rocks to crack open hard shells, as well as food for later. They are
				most commonly found near kelp forests off the coast of the Pacific
				Ocean.
